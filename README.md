# Helium-ground-state-energy
The repository is composed by two different codes. Correct_Energy_Value.py uses the Metropolis algorithm and the VMC technique in order to find the correct value of the Helium nucleus ground state energy. Find_Optimal_Pars.py, instead, is able to find the optimal values of the variational parameters used in VMC technique starting in a neighbourhood of the optimal ones.
